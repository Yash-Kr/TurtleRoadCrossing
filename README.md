<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project  üëÄ

![ezgif com-gif-maker-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64688647/124384557-700b1100-dcef-11eb-80e8-57284e7a1c79.gif)


There are many great games built using javascripts, however, I find the Python's Turle module very interesting. So I decided to create this turtle game from scratch with not great UI but still I hope you people will love it.-- I think this is it.

Game Features :
* The game runs on a defined screen-size which is built simply using turtle screen class
* It listens to key stroke events and triggers the necessary callbacks needed to move the turtle
* It also have a score-keeper which keeps track of the user's current score
* Difficulty increases as the user completes the current level

Of course, The project is not at its best level. But I'll be adding more features and customising its UI in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. You are extremely welcome.
